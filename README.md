## ðŸ§  Notes

- Counts are approximate and may change over time.
- Some links require manual data extraction (e.g., XLS, interactive sites).
- Some entries are alias-heavy, some have small descriptions, while others are TTP-focused or cloud-specific.
- Useful for CTI analysts, red teamers, blue teamers, and researchers.
